# Codewars Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to challenges from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com).
The challenges are organized by difficulty level, following the ranking system on Codewars: from **8 kyu** (easiest) to **1 kyu** (most difficult).  

## Repository Structure

- **`8-kyu`** — Beginner-level challenges, perfect for those just starting out.
- **`7-kyu`** — Easy challenges for practicing basic programming concepts.
- **`6-kyu`** — Intermediate-level challenges.
- **`5-kyu`** — Advanced-level challenges.
- **`4-kyu`** — For experienced developers.
- **`3-kyu`** — Difficult challenges for professionals.
- **`2-kyu`** — Very hard challenges for experts.
- **`1-kyu`** — The most complex challenges on Codewars.

Each folder contains files named after specific challenges, including their description and my solutions.

Each file contains:
1. A description of the challenge (in comments at the beginning of the file).
2. My solution using JavaScript.
